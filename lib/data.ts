         'So You Think Ants Can Dance utilized motion capture data from the Carnegie Mellon Motion Capture Database to bring animated characters to life. By composing transformations in a hierarchical scene graph, I scaled, rotated, and translated basic shapes to create complex characters and integrated motion capture data to produce smooth, looping animations and dynamic motion overlays. This project also honed my skills in reading and extending sophisticated computer graphics code, enabling lifelike character animations and choreography in interactive scenes.',

      description:
         'In this computer graphics project, I implemented advanced GLSL shaders to create artistic rendering techniques including cartoon-style shading with silhouette outlines and normal mapping for enhanced surface texture detail. By developing vertex and fragment shaders, I demonstrated skills in manipulating per-pixel lighting, transforming geometric vertices, and using texture lookups to create sophisticated visual effects similar to those used in video games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The project involved complex graphics programming techniques such as calculating lighting intensities, creating two-pass rendering approaches, and transforming coordinates between different spaces to achieve realistic and stylized rendering effects.',

         'A World Made of Drawings inspired by the children\'s book "Harold and the Purple Crayon," I developed an interactive 3D drawing application that allows users to create and modify a virtual world through intuitive mouse-based interactions. The project involved implementing complex graphics algorithms for drawing strokes in the sky, creating billboards, dynamically reshaping terrain, and adjusting camera height based on ground elevation, demonstrating advanced skills in mesh manipulation, ray casting, and coordinate space transformations. By following a research paper\'s approach to non-photorealistic rendering, I created a playful and innovative system that translates 2D mouse strokes into 3D modeling operations, showcasing the creative potential of computer graphics techniques.',
